EXPERIENCE        
Food Flow Modelling（Research Assistant, UIUC）                                           Jun 2020-present 
• Analyze the network characteristics for household-scale commodity level in Zambia, including centrality, degree, and strength distribution.
• Apply logistic regression, spatial correlation, and multi-layer correlations to distinguish the drivers of the sharing that occurs between households in Zambia.
• Employ logistic regression and linear programming in conjunction with the gamma hurdle model, to estimate the existence of links and weight of county-level food flow by time.
